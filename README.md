# Guess the Number game programmed in java 

### Introduction
The program is a number guessing game implemented in Java. It allows the user to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The user is prompted to enter their guess, and the program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low. The game continues until the user correctly guesses the number. After each successful guess, the program displays the number of tries it took. The user has the option to play again by entering "yes" or exit the game by entering "no".

This game is a simple and interactive way to test your guessing skills and have fun while trying to guess the correct number within a limited number of attempts.
